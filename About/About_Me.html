        <h3>Hi! Myself Prabeen!</h3>
        <p> I'm a Data Enthusiast with an Engineering background presently pursuing MSc in Data Science and Digital Marketing (majoring in Data Science) at EmLyon Business School Paris. Prior to this, I had been employed with Accenture as an Application Development Analyst for 3 years. During my 3 years with Accenture, I learned Oracle PL/SQL, Informatica Power Centre, Oracle Lodestar, Control M Scheduler,Tableau and most importantly I learned how to perform under pressure situations and deliver project deliverables within short deadlines.</p>
        <p>For the past 10 months, I have been learning about the core data analytics tools/languages (R, Python), Machine learning algorithms (like linear regression, polynomial regression, supervised/unsupervised learning, tree-based models, SVM, Clustering, etc), Marketing analytics with python, concepts of digital marketing, programmatic advertising and web analytics, which are required to be a successful data analyst or Business analyst or digital marketing professional. Moreover, I enjoy working in an international and multicultural environment. I love challenges and I can assure you that with my data analytical skills, marketing skills and with the knowledge of AI which have gained through my master's, I can help any company in leveraging data for solving business problems. </p>
