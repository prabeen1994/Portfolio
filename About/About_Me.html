        <h3>Hi! Myself Prabeen!</h3>
        <p> I'm a Data Enthusiast with an Engineering background presently pursuing MSc in Data Science and Digital Marketing (majoring in Data Science) at EmLyon Business School Paris. Prior to this, I had been employed with Accenture as an Application Development Analyst for 3 years. During my 3 years with Accenture, I learned Oracle PL/SQL, Informatica Power Centre, Oracle Lodestar, Control M Scheduler,Tableau and most importantly I learned how to perform under pressure situations and deliver project deliverables within short deadlines.</p>
        <p>Now in my masters, I am learning skills that are required to be a successful data analyst/ Business analyst. I am comfortable in handling programming languages like R, Python(pandas, NumPy,matplotlib, seaborn, Scikit learn), C++, and analytical tools like Tableau/Power BI/R shiny. In addition to this, I am also learning the concepts of machine learning(Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, random forest, SVM, Clustering, etc) using python Scikit Learn package.</p>
